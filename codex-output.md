Added a “Spring colors 2” storefront look without touching logic: new data-theme tokens, gradients, and component styles live under `spring-*` selectors in `src/app/globals.css`. Updated `src/app/page.tsx` to detect the `spring-colors-2` slug from Supabase (only when status=ready and enabled), apply the scoped spring classes, and refresh hero/products/events copy for the Spring Launch Event.

Next steps: set a “Spring colors 2” theme row to ready + enabled in Supabase, then run `npm run dev` to preview the spring look; leave the flag off to keep the base style.
