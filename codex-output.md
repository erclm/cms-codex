- Added a scoped New Years palette and component styles under `data-theme="new-years-event"` in `src/app/globals.css`, keeping prior themes intact while introducing aurora/gold accents, chips, buttons, cards, and shell treatments that only apply when the flag is on.
- Updated `src/app/page.tsx` to recognize the `new-years-event` slug from Supabase, swap in New Years copy, highlights, badges, and CTA text, and apply the new scoped classes without touching base or other themes.

Tests not run (not requested). If you want to see the look, set a Supabase `themes` row with title “New years event” (status `ready`, `enabled` true) so the data-theme flag activates.
