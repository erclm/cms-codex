Added a minimal “Pop-up Preview” theme hook that only renders a small “hello” chip on the hero when the theme flag is active, keeping all existing storefront behavior intact. Updated `src/app/page.tsx` to gate the hello chip behind the `pop-up-preview` theme slug, and appended a scoped data-theme block with reuse of existing tokens plus styling for the chip in `src/app/globals.css`. Base look remains unchanged unless a ready+enabled Supabase theme with that title is active.

Next steps: set/enable the “Pop-up Preview” theme row (status ready) in Supabase to see the hello chip; nothing else changes.
